<p>
    By default the Gerrit trigger plugin filters out comments posted by the
    configured user from the event stream. This means that it is not possible
    to trigger builds on these messages. Setting this option will give access to
    the unfiltered stream.

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong> that with this option enabled, it is possible to create infinite loops.
    For example, a trigger on a Verified +1 will loop infinitally on successful
    builds.

    Default is disabled.
